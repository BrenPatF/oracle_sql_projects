# Oracle SQL Projects / sums_products
This project has the code and other artefacts for small SQL projects, including mp4 recordings that explain the project.

## sums_products
The sums_products subproject has the scripts and artefacts for a blog post, [A Note on Running Sums and Products in SQL](http://aprogrammerwrites.eu/?p=2679). I explain the post in a tweet recording (< 2m20s), followed up by three further tweets explaining the SQL techniques more generally (the latter are in the analytics_and_recursion_explainers subproject).
