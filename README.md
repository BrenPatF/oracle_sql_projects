# Oracle SQL Projects
<img src="mountains.png">
This project has the code and other artefacts for small SQL projects, including mp4 recordings that explain the project.

:file_cabinet: :question: :outbox_tray:

## sums_products
The sums_products subproject has the scripts and artefacts for a blog post, [A Note on Running Sums and Products in SQL](http://aprogrammerwrites.eu/?p=2679). I explain the post in a tweet recording (< 2m20s), followed up by three further tweets explaining the SQL techniques more generally (the latter are in the analytics_and_recursion_explainers subproject).

## analytics_and_recursion_explainers
The analytics_and_recursion_explainers subproject has the scripts and artefacts for a Twitter thread in which I explain how three SQL techniques work, in a single tweet recording (< 2m20s) each.

## Installation
The project code consists of SQL query scripts that can be run from sqlplus as long as the pre-requisites are in place.
### Install pre-requisite tools (if necessary)
#### Oracle database with HR demo schema
The database installation requires a minimum Oracle version of 11.2, with Oracle's HR demo schema installed [Oracle Database Software Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/oracle-database-software-downloads.html).

If HR demo schema is not installed, it can be got from here: [Oracle Database Sample Schemas](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/server.112/e10831/installation.htm#COMSC001).

### Running the Scripts
See the subproject READMEs:
- [README: sums_products](sums_products/README.md)
- [README: analytics_and_recursion_explainers](analytics_and_recursion_explainers/README.md)
